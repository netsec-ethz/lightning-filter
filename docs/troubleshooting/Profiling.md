git clone https://github.com/brendangregg/FlameGraph
cd FlameGraph
```

Sample system with perf:

./flamegraph.pl out.perf-folded > perf.svg
```

## Intel VTune

After installing VTune (on the monitoring device), set up the environment variables:

```
source <install-dir>/setvars.sh
```

Then start the VTune GUI:

```
vtune-gui
```

### Sampling Driver

The source is located in the VTune Profiler installation directory `<install_dir>/sepdk`. For remote targets, the source is located in `<install_dir>/target`, which can be copied to the remote and extracted there.

The installation is described in `sepdk/src/README.md`.

```shell
cd /path/to/sepdk/src/  #/opt/intel/oneapi/vtune/latest/sepdk/src
./build-driver          #maybe sudo 
sudo ./rmmod-sep
sudo ./insmod-sep
```

Add user to vtune group:

```
sudo usermod -a -G vtune <username>
```
