# LightningFilter (Open Source)

LightningFilter is a high-speed traffic filtering mechanism that performs authentication, rate limiting, and duplicate detection.
LightningFilter uses the DPDK framework, enabling high-speed packet processing.

This repository contains the open-source version, which offers at least the core functionalities of a LightningFilter.
The closed-source version provides additional functionalities and better performance (~5x throughput).

# Installation

See [docs/Installation.md](docs/Installation.md) for detailed information.

There are mainly two possibilities to build LightingFilter: with the help of a docker container or natively on a machine.
Both of the options rely on Ubuntu 22.04.

## Docker Container

Install docker and add the user to the docker group.
Then run the `docker.sh` script to create the docker image and container that builds LightningFilter.

```
./docker.sh build <CMAKE_ARGS>
```

> Note: Once a CMake flag is set for a build, it does not change its value for the following build calls.

## Native

To install dependencies, we use the script provided in `usertools` and then set the required environment variables:

```
./usertools/install_deps.sh
source dependencies/env_vars
```

To build LightningFilter we use CMake.
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ../
make
```

## Docker Container

For the docker container build, install docker and add the user to the docker group.
Then run the `docker.sh` script to create the docker image and container that builds LightningFilter.

```
./docker.sh build <CMAKE_ARGS>
```

> Note: Because CMake flags are cached, once set, any following build call uses them.

# Run

After compiling the application, the executable is in `build/src/` and can be run as follows:

```
build/src/lf <EAL Parameters> -- <LF Parameters>
```

LightningFilter expects various parameters, which are divided into EAL and LF parameters.
Script examples that run LightningFilter can be found in the test directory, e.g., in [test/perfnet_ip](test/perfnet_ip).

DPDK defines the EAL parameters, which are described [here](https://doc.dpdk.org/guides/linux_gsg/linux_eal_parameters.html).
The application's help text describes the LF parameters.

E.g.:

```
build/src/lf --lcores (0-2)@(0-2),(3-7)@(3,7) --log-level lf:debug \
-- \
-p 0x1 --portmap "(0,0,o),(0,0,i)" --c lf_config.json
```

More info: [docs/Parameters.md](docs/Parameters.md)

## Statistics

The DPDK telemetry API provides information and statistics of a running DPDK instance.
Also, LightningFilter collects additional statistics and exposes them to the same interface.

Launch interactive client script:

```
sudo ./usertools/lf-telemetry.py
```

When using a file prefix, the file prefix is set with the -f flag:

```
sudo ./usertools/lf-telemetry.py -f "file_prefix"
```

More info: [docs/Metrics.md](docs/Metrics.md)

## Runtime Interface

LightningFilter provides an interface through a Unix socket during runtime, just as for the statistics.

Launch interactive client script:

```
sudo ./usertools/lf-ipc.py
```

When running LightningFilter with a file prefix, set the file prefix as follows:

```
sudo ./usertools/lf-ipc.py -f "file_prefix"
```

The script also allows running single commands without starting the interactive mode:

```
sudo ./usertools/lf-ipc.py --cmd=<command> {--params=<parameters>}
```

# Develop

To get quickly started with developing LightningFilter, we provide a docker image with all the necessary dependencies installed.
The following commands build the developer image and create a docker container:

```
./docker.sh dev_image && ./docker.sh dev_up
```

With VS Code, you can directly start coding within the container using `docker` extension.

# Tests

## Unit Tests

(in the build directory)

```
make run_tests
```

> The tests require additional packages:
>```
>sudo apt-get install bsdmainutils tmux
>```

## Integration Tests
### SCION

(in `test/testnet_scion`)

```
sudo ./integration_test.sh ../../build/src/lf ~/scion
```

> Requires an appropriate build (see README in directory).

### IP

(in `test/testnet_ip`)

```
sudo ./integration_test.sh ../../build/src/lf
```

> Requires an appropriate build (see README in directory).

## Test Script

To run all of the unit and integration tests with different settings (compilation configurations), run the script `run_tests.sh`.

## Performance Tests

For the performance tests, use the test configurations in the directories `test/perfnet_scion` and `test/perfnet_ip`.
The `README.md`, in the corresponding directories, provides additional information on the setup and required adjustments.
